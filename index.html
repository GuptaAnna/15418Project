    Solving the 15-Puzzle with Parallel A*
    </p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">
    <font size="5"> Summary </font>
    <br>
    We will implement a parallel version of the A* algorithm to solve the 15-Puzzle with minimal moves on the Gates 
    or latedays machines.
    </p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">
    <font size="5"> Background </font>
    <br>
    The 15-Puzzle consists of a 4x4 frame of square tiles (numbered from 1 to 15), with one tile missing. 
    The object of the game is to place the tiles in numerical order by sliding tiles, using the empty space.
    The puzzle can come in different sizes; in general, a NxN frame will use tiles numbered from 1 to N<sup>2</sup> - 1. 
      
    <br>
    The game can be represented as a graph, with nodes being the state of the board and edges representing an action 
    (sliding a particular tile). We would like to implement a graph-searching algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves
    to solve the puzzle. 
      
    <br>
    In graph-search algorithms, a heuristic ranks edges from a node, based on an algorithm. This decides which actions are preferable, 
    given the state of the game. The 15-Puzzle is perfect for an algorithm involving heuristics. One possible heuristic for the puzzle 
    uses the taxicab distances for each tile (difference in distance between actual and desired positions). This opens the door for us 
    to use A* (or other heuristic algorithms) to solve the puzzle.

    <p class="w3-justify">
    <font size="5"> The Challenge </font>
    <br>
    Unlike other graph-search algorithms, A* is difficult to implement in parallel due to the heuristic. The sequential version of
    the algorithm utilizes a priority queue, ranking the nodes by cost or preference. In an iteration, the least-cost node is popped 
    from the priority queue, information is updated, and the neighbors of the node are added to the queue. These neighbors could 
    have a higher preference than nodes previously existing in the queue, making it difficult to utilize multiple threads. It might 
    not be viable to have multiple threads working on different nodes in the queue - since the second-preferred node in the queue 
    may not be the first-preferred node after the iteration. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">
    <font size="5"> Resources </font>
    <br>
    We will start writing code from scratch. We will research A* and other heuristic algorithms to determine 
    one that is optimal for solving the 15-Puzzle. We will also determine a benchmark for speed-up that can 
    be acquired by parallelizing A* by reading research papers. We will utilize the Gates or latedays clusters 
    for our project. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">
    <font size="5"> Goals &amp; Deliverables </font>
    </p>
    Goals: 
    <ul class="w3-justify">
    <li> Implement a sequential version of A* in the context of the 15-Puzzle </li>
    <li> Research the A* algorithm and determine a desired speed-up goal between sequential and parallel versions </li>
    <li> Implement a parallel version using CUDA, achieving the desired speed-up </li>
    <li> Compare speed-up across varying number of threads and determine an optimal number of threads to use</li>
    <li> Test our implementation on larger versions of the 15-Puzzle, varying the width of the board</li>
    </ul> 
      
    If time permits:
    <ul class="w3-justify">
    <li> Experiment with variants of the A* algorithm and compare which results in the largest speedup</li>
    <li> Achieve parallelism through different method - for example, using OpenMP </li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p class="w3-justify">
    We will construct a rubric for our work by researching prior attempts to parallelize A* and the speed-ups they received. 
    Ideally, we would like to achieve as close to the best speed-up achieved as possible.
    </p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">
    <br>
    <font size="5"> Platform Choice </font>
    <br>
    CUDA will give us access to a large number of threads - which will be useful in solving large instances of the puzzle. 
    In addition, we can utilize thread blocks and shared memory as a form of communication between the threads.
